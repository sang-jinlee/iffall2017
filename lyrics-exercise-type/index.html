	In between the notes of your favorite song<br>
	You try to figure where it went wrong<br><br></span>
	
	<span class="outer">
	But it went wrong long ago<br>
	In many different ways<br><br></span>

	<span class="inner">
	You try and feel your way through the groove<br>
	And though you're sad your feet start to move<br><br></span>
	
	<span class="outer">
	Let the tears fall anyway<br>
	You'll clean up when you're done<br><br>

	You stomp your feet along with the drum<br>
	You try to calculate the sum<br>
	Of all the times you tried and lost<br><br></span>

	<span class="inner">
	All your wasted yesterdays</span><br><br>

	<span class="outer">
	You wait around but no one comes by<br>
	And though you're sad you don't wonder why<br>
	I find meaning in this life when I wake up every day<br>
	But I'm feeling sick and tired in new and frightening ways<br><br></span>

	<strong>No don't cover my eyes</strong><br><br>

	<span class="inner">
	I wanna be afraid<br>
	I am opening my heart<br>
	That's the promise I have made<br></span>
